This file attempts to describe the maintainer-specific notes to follow
when hacking liblouisxml. 

* Release Procedure
These steps describe what a maintainer does to make a release; they
are not needed for ordinary patch submission.

** Set the version number
Update the version number in NEWS (with version, date, and release
type), ChangeLog and configure.ac.

** Commit and tag
Commit the changes and tag this version

  svn cp https://liblouisxml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk \
     https://liblouisxml.googlecode.com/svn/tags/liblouisxml_1_8_0

If you know the exact version number that needs to be tagged use

  svn cp https://liblouisxml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk \
     https://liblouisxml.googlecode.com/svn/tags/liblouisxml_1_8_0 -r 109

** Make the release
Check out a clean copy in a different directory, like /tmp. Run
autogen.sh and configure with no special prefixes. Run make distcheck.
This will make sure that all needed files are present, and do a
general sanity check. Run make dist. This will produce a tarball.

  ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make distcheck && make dist

** Upload
Upload tarball to Google project page, tag as "featured". This will
put the link on the main project page. Remove "featured" tag from
previous tarball release. 

** Online documentation
The online documentation is hosted out of subversion of the Google
code site. To check it out

   svn co https://liblouisxml.googlecode.com/svn/documentation \
     liblouisxml-online-documentation

then move the latest built documentation into this directory and check
it in

   cd liblouisxml-online-documentation
   cp ../liblouisxml/doc/liblouisxml.html .
   svn ci liblouisxml.html -m "Update online documentation"

** Announce
Send an announcement to the liblouisxml list
liblouis-liblouisxml@freelists.org. See ANNOUNCEMENT for an example.

** Other web updates
Update the Google project page. Add the current NEWS to the front
page.
