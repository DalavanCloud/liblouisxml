Follow these steps to install liblouis and liblouisxml on Mac OS X 10.5. 
Because of problems with the pkg-config program, The standard autotooled 
version of liblouisxml will not work on the Mac. It has therefore been 
necessary to devise a special build proceduoe.

1. Get the latest tarball of liblouis from www.abilitiessoft.com and 
	unpack it.

2. In the directory it produces type ./configure --prefix=/usr

3. Type make

4. Get root privileges and type make install. This will put liblouis and 
	its tables and tools in the standard Mac locations.

5. Return to the directory where you are reading this.

6. Type ./copyfiles

7. type make

8. Get root privileges and type ./install NOT make install

You should now be able to run xml2brl like any other Mac command-line 
program.
