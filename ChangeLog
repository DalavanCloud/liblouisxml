Release liblouisxml-1.4.2, June 16, 2008

Converted to Gnu autotools

A few bugs fixed

Release liblouisxml-1.4.1

linux-Makefile optimized for RedHat

If there are errors in a liblouis table you will now get only a single 
arror report instead of myriads.

Release liblouisxml-1.4.0, May 12, 2008

doc directory renamed docs . Semantic-action and configuration files in 
this directory have been prefixed with example_ 

mode  parameter added to functions in liblouisxml.h

Cdata sections can now be translated as text, computer code or ignored.

A function to find the true namo of the "Program Files" directory in 
Windows has been written by Yuemei Sun of ViewPlus Technologies. It is 
in the paths.c module.

Paths for translation tables, semantic action files and configuration 
files can now be assigned more flexibly. See paths.c

xml2brl will now accept configuration settings on the command line, so 
it is unnecessary to change a configuration file.

It is now possible to pass a configuration string in memory to the 
library, not just the name of a configuration file.

For details on all these changes see docs/liblouisxml-guide.html
